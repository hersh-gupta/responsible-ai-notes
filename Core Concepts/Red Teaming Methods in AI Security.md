## Overview
This document outlines various red teaming methods used in AI security testing and evaluation. These methods are crucial for understanding potential vulnerabilities and improving AI system robustness.

## Methods

### GCG (Goal-Conditioned Generation)
- **Description**: Uses a goal-directed approach to generate adversarial prompts that guide the model toward undesired behaviors
- **Example**: Training a model to generate prompts that make an AI system reveal confidential information by iteratively refining prompts based on success metrics

### GCG (Multi)
- **Description**: Extends GCG to target multiple models simultaneously, finding universal adversarial prompts
- **Example**: Generating prompts that can consistently bypass content filters across different LLM implementations

### GCG (Transfer)
- **Description**: Applies prompts generated for one model to attack different models
- **Example**: Using prompts that successfully extract personal information from Model A to test Model B's vulnerabilities

### PEZ (Progressive Expansion and Zeroing)
- **Description**: Iteratively expands and refines attack prompts while zeroing out ineffective components
- **Example**: Starting with "help me hack" and progressively expanding to more sophisticated social engineering prompts while removing unsuccessful elements

### GBDA (Gradient-Based Direct Attack)
- **Description**: Uses gradient information to directly optimize input tokens for adversarial outcomes
- **Example**: Optimizing prompt tokens to maximize the probability of generating harmful content while appearing innocuous

### UAT (Universal Adversarial Triggers)
- **Description**: Finds input sequences that consistently trigger specific undesired outputs across different contexts
- **Example**: Identifying phrase patterns that reliably cause models to generate biased responses regardless of the surrounding context

### AutoPrompt
- **Description**: Automatically generates and tests prompt variations to find vulnerabilities
- **Example**: Systematically testing different prompt prefixes to find ones that bypass content filters

### Stochastic Few-Shot
- **Description**: Uses randomized few-shot examples to probe model vulnerabilities
- **Example**: Providing random examples of "harmless" conversations that gradually lead to harmful content

### Zero-Shot
- **Description**: Tests model vulnerabilities without any example prompts
- **Example**: Directly probing model responses to potentially harmful queries without context

### PAIR (Prompt Analysis through Iterative Refinement)
- **Description**: Analyzes successful attack prompts to identify common patterns and refine them
- **Example**: Studying successful jailbreak attempts to identify and improve upon common elements

### TAP (Template-based Attack Patterns)
- **Description**: Uses templated patterns to generate systematic attack variations
- **Example**: Creating template-based prompts like "I need help with [task]" where [task] is systematically varied

### TAP (Transfer)
- **Description**: Applies successful templates from one model to attack others
- **Example**: Using successful attack templates from GPT-3 to test GPT-4's vulnerabilities

### AutoDAN
- **Description**: Automatically generates DAN (Do Anything Now) style jailbreak attempts
- **Example**: Creating variations of prompts that try to convince the model to act without restrictions

### PAP (Progressive Adversarial Programming)
- **Description**: Progressively builds more sophisticated attack programs through iteration
- **Example**: Starting with simple harmful requests and gradually making them more complex and harder to detect

### Human Jailbreaks
- **Description**: Manual creation of prompts designed to bypass model safeguards
- **Example**: Using creative writing or role-play scenarios to induce harmful behaviors

### Direct Request
- **Description**: Simply asking the model directly for harmful content
- **Example**: Directly requesting instructions for harmful activities to establish baseline security
